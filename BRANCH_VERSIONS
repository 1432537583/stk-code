version_0_1:	Added PROFILE define to support automatic profiling.
version_0_2:    Added most of the files from supertux, and got everything
                to at least compile, but it's currently still mostly broken.
                Added new files to encapsulate the code for the single
                window menu system.
version_0_3:	The single- and multi-window menues are now working (though
		not the actual race).
version_0_4:	First roughly working version - quite slow, not really
                steerable via keyboard, but the cars are moving.
version_0_5:	- Bug fix for physics (way too high z speed causing
                  too many collision calls).
                - Simplified kart/driver structure by removing the
                  driver and creating different kart objects instead.
                - Moved keyboard code to playerkart.
                - New MaterialManager in separate object.
                - new attachment and collectable objects.
                - new projectile/explosion code and manager
                  Currently missiles fly and hit, but then it crashes.
                - new hook manager.
                 
version_0_6:	- Fixed keyboard handling, so that fire and similar
                  'action' keys would only fire when they are pressed
                  for the first time.
		- Projectiles and explosions now work properly.
                  Fixed minor bug (projectiles would be sped up when
                  flying over a zipper)
		- Magnets are working again.
		- Added waiting for 'go', added penalty wait for
		  players who don't wait.
version_1_0:	- Big renaming: Driver->Moveable; KartDriver to Kart.
                - Restructuring: moved parts of code from moveable
                  to kart.
                - Imported supertuxkart tracks (though they are currently
                  too slow to be called playable).
version_1_1:    - New HOT and collision algorithm --> all tracks are now
                  playable.
                - --profile can now take the number of frames
		- fps display for profiling
