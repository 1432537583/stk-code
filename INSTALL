SUPERTUXKART INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
======================================

General
-------

First, make sure that you have the following packages installed:

  * OpenGL (or Mesa 3.0 or later)
  * Irrlicht 1.7 or later
  * OpenAL

Unpack the files from the tarball like this:

  tar xzf supertuxkart-*.tar.gz
  cd supertuxkart-*


where '*' is the version of SuperTuxkart you downloaded - eg 0.2.0. Then:

  ./configure
  make

To test the compilation, supertuxkart can be run from the build
directory by ./src/supertuxkart  (./src/supertuxkart.exe on windows).

To install the file, as root execute:

  make install

The default install location is /usr/local, i.e. the data files will
be written to /usr/local/share/games/supertuxkart, the executable
will be copied to /usr/local/bin. To change the default installation
location, use the "--prefix" option of configure, e.g. --prefix=/usr
See the --help output of configure for further options.


SVN STK on Ubuntu
-----------------
Here are the compilation instructions for the current svn(2009-10-15) of
Super Tux Kart originally contributed by Damien for Ubuntu Edgy, and updated
to 9.04 version:

install following packages:
# apt-get install libtool libxxf86vm-dev libopenal-dev
libglu1-mesa-dev subversion autoconf automake1.9 g++ gcc

do a:
$ svn checkout https://supertuxkart.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/supertuxkart/main/branches/irrlicht

Get irrlicht-1.6.zip and unzip it, compile irrlicht:
$ cd irrlicht-1.6/source/Irrlicht/
$ make
$ cd ../../..
$ pwd
/some/path/

then we can move to stk, remember to replace the output of pwd below:
$ cd trunk
$ ./autogen.sh && ./configure --enable-irrlicht --with-irrlicht=/some/path/irrlicht-1.6/ && make
and if all went well run the game:
$ src/supertuxkart

tested with g++ 3.3 and 4.1 , both succeeded.

If you want to install the game system-wide, do 'make install'.

To update the source from inside trunk directory, one simple command:
$ svn up
and then, in most cases, just rebuild:
$ make
with the exception of changes to any Makefile.am, in which case:
$ ./autogen.sh && ./configure --enable-irrlicht --with-irrlicht=/some/path/irrlicht-1.6/ && make


But it didn't work!
-------------------

If you checked out your copy directly from SVN, you have to run
'sh autogen.sh' to generate the configure script.

You should check the SuperTuxKart wiki at:

http://supertuxkart.sourceforge.net/


Also, the most common (by FAR) reason for problems is that your OpenGL/Mesa
is incorrectly installed - so before you complain to any of the Irrlicht or
Supertuxkart mailing lists, first try running one of the example programs
that comes with your OpenGL implementation - or one of the Mesa or GLUT
sample programs.

If THOSE run correctly - but Supertuxkart doesn't then please get in touch
with the SupertuxKart mailing list and we'll do our best to get you up and
racing.
