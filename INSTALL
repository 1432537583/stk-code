SUPERTUXKART INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS.
=======================================

INSTALLATION:
-------------

First, make sure that you have the following packages installed:

  * OpenGL (or Mesa 3.0 or later)
  * PLIB version 1.8.4 or later

Unpack the files from the tarball like this:

  tar xzf supertuxkart-*.tar.gz
  cd supertuxkart-*


where '*' is the version of SuperTuxkart you downloaded - eg 0.2.0. Then:

  ./configure
  make

To test the compilation, supertuxkart can be run from the build
directory by ./src/supertuxkart  (./src/supertuxkart.exe on windows).

To install the file, as root execute:

  make install

The default install location is /usr/local, i.e. the data files will
be written to /usr/local/share/games/supertuxkart, the executable
will be copied to /usr/local/bin. To change the default installation
location, use the "--prefix" option of configure, e.g. --prefix=/usr
See the --help output of configure for further options.


But it didn't work!
-------------------

Right now there is no proper windows compilation. You can still compile for windows using cygwin, see README.cygwin for details.

Also, the most common (by FAR) reason for problems is that your OpenGL/Mesa
is incorrectly installed - so before you complain to any of the PLIB or
Supertuxkart mailing lists, first try running one of the example programs
that comes with your OpenGL implementation - or one of the Mesa or GLUT
sample programs.

If you those examples run OK - then go to the PLIB home page and download
the PLIB examples.

If THOSE run correctly - but Supertuxkart doesn't then please get in touch 
with the SupertuxKart mailing list and we'll do our best to get you up and 
racing.
