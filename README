SuperTuxKart
==============
SuperTuxKart is a free kart racing game. It is focusing on fun and
not on realistic kart physics. Instruction can be found on the
in-game help page.

The SuperTuxKart homepage can be found at:

The official SuperTuxKart forum is at. If you need support,
this would be the best place to start.

Hope you enjoy the game.

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
=====================
* You need a 3D graphics card that supports OpenGL or Mesa.
* You should have a CPU that's running at 450MHz or better.
* You'll need at least 128Mb RAM. 
* A sound card would be nice - but it's not essential.
* Ideally, you want a joystick with at least 6 buttons.



COMPILING ON WINDOWS
====================
A project file for Visual Studio 9 (e.g. the free 2008 express 
edition) is included in the sources. A separate dependency 
package is available on SuperTuxKart's sourceforge page, which
includes all necessary libraries, header files, and dlls to
compile and run the source code.

While compilation with cygwin is not officially supported,
this has been done (check with the forum for details).
