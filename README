HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
=====================
* You need a 3D graphics card that supports OpenGL or Mesa.
* You should have a CPU that's running at 450MHz or better.
* You'll need at least 32Mb RAM. 
* A sound card would be nice - but it's not essential.
* Ideally, you want a joystick with at least 6 buttons.

PLAYING THE GAME
================
SuperTuxKart is a kart racing game. Basically you run around the track,
and give your best shot at reaching the goal before your opponents. The ?
boxes can help you, and certain items can build up your power, so you can
grab more than one collectable!

Controls can be configured from the game, here are the defaults mappings:

Player 1:
  Steer      : Left / Right arrow
  Accelerate : Up arrow
  Brake      : Down arrow
  Use item   : Right control
  Wheelie    : Right shift
  Rescue     : Backspace

Player 2:
  Steer      : J / L key
  Accelerate : I key
  Brake      : K key
  Use item   : M key
  Wheelie    : . key
  Rescue     : / key

Player 3 and 4 do not have default control configurations.
The Escape key pauses the game and shows the race menu.

KNOWN BUGS
==========
  * Sometimes you can be pushed through a solid object if you are hit by
    another player when in contact with the surface.
  * The --track command-line option doesn't seems to work.
