SuperTuxKart
============

SuperTuxKart is based on Tuxkart (http://tuxkart.sourceforge.net)
by Steve Baker. It was picked up by the Linux Game of the Month
project and got a big overhaul during this time, but was left in
an unfinished state. 
A new set of maintainers, namely hiker & coz took over in 2006, 
and we are glad to annouce our first release here. You can find
more details on:

  http://supertuxkart.berlios.de


Supertuxkart needs hardware OpenGL support, and has currently only one
software dependency: plib, see http://plib.sourceforge.net

A big "thank you" to Steve Baker for designing and implementing
the original tuxkart, to the GotM team for their invaluable work.
See the AUTHORS file for individual credits.

To contact the current maintainers, please send an email to the
supertuxkart development list at:

Hope you enjoy te game

PLAYING THE GAME
================
Supertuxkart is a kart racing game. Basically, you run a certain
number of laps and try to be faster than your opponents. Power 
ups, like accelerator, rockets, can help you to achieve this
goal. By collecting coins you build up your power, which enables
you to get more power ups whenever you collect one. The arrow-
shaped red and black 'zippers' on the track will give you a quick
speedup. 

At the same time, there are bananas out on the track, which effect
you negatively: an anvil or parachute will slow you down for a 
while.
If you are running rather fast, you can pop a wheelie, which gives
you an additional speed boost, but you can't steer your kart 
while doing a wheelie, so be carefuel.
Hitting another kart does not do any damage to your kart or the
other kart, one of the karts will just be forced to a stand still,
loosing precious seconds.

Three different game modes are available:
1) Quick Race
   A single race (with between 1 and 5 laps)

2) Time Trial
   A single race with a single lap only

3) Grand Prix
   A set of several races, each with several laps

Split screen multi-player is supported, though you need a somewhat
powerful computer and graphics card to get a high frame rate in this
case. Network multiplayer is not yet supported.


CONTROLLING YOUR KART
=====================
Ideally, you need a 'gamepad' style joystick with at least six buttons:

  Joystick Left/Right:  Steer.

  A button - Accellerate.
  B button - Brake.
  C button - Use an item you've collected
  D button - Ask to be rescued by tinytux.
  L button - Pop a wheelie (if you are going fast enough).
  R button - Jump.

In addition, you can drive from the keyboard:

  LEFT/RIGHT ARROW: Steer.

  UP-ARROW   - Same as 'A' button - Accellerate
  DOWN-ARROW - Same as 'B' button - Brake

  A key - Same as 'L' button - pop a Wheelie
  S key - Same as 'R' button - Jump
  D key - Same as 'D' button - Rescue Me Please!
  F key - Same as 'C' button - Use an item.

  ESCAPE- Pauses the game, popping up a menu with
          additional options (including returning
          or restarting the race).

This is the default binding. In the options->control
menu you can assign your preferred keys to the kart
handling functions. 

Usually, rescuing occurs automatically when your kart leaves
a track (e.g. drives into the sea, or into a volcano), but if
you find yourself in a situation with no way out, you can 
always request a TinyTux to be sent out - which will lift your
kart up and drop you back on the track, approximately where you 
left the track.

There are also some debug functions left for developers:

  F10 key - Save the last 1000 frames into a file ./history.dat
            This can be used by the developers to reproduce
            problems occuring during a race.
  F11 key - Toggle wireframe view.
  F12 key - Toggle frame-per-second display.

The menu structure should be mostly self explanatory. Be aware that
pressing the escape key will return to the previous menu. Pressing
escape during a race will pause the game


POWERUPS:
---------
There are currently many 'good things' (triggered by driving over a blue
cube) and a few 'bad things' (triggered by hitting a banana).

Good things are collectables - you pick them up by driving through the
blue cube and activate them by "using" an item (see above for default
key bindings)

Bad things happen immediately - and last for a few seconds before 'going
away' by themselves.

Notice that (unlike some kart games), the computer controlled players
also collect and use powerups.

Silver and Gold coins gradually fill up the energy level - as you collect
more coins, you'll find that a blue box will subsequently give you two, 
three, four or five powerups at one time!

Good Things:

    * Missiles - unguided but fast. If they hit anything (including the
      track), they explode impressively. The effect on a Kart is to stop 
      it dead - so you have to accellerate again.
    * Homing missiles - slower than the regular kind - but they track
      the nearest kart and are quite hard to shake off.
    * Fuzzy blobs - even slower still - a kart can outrun them quite
      easily. They ricochet off the sides of the track and only explode
      when they hit a Kart. Since they are not moving fast, they'll
      tend to stay close to where you dropped them.
    * Magnets - if you activate a magnet then it hangs around for 
      about 15 seconds. If anyone comes within about 20 meters, 
      you'll be pulled towards them and end up glued to their tail 
      until the magnet 'expires'. Great for catching up with someone 
      - hopeless for passing them. Magnets can be disabled by using 
      them again, allowing you to escape from the magnetic grip of
      another kart.
    * Portable Zippers - these are just like the zippers on the track
      itself - they give you a sudden accelleration and temporarily
      increase the top speed of your kart.

Bad Things:

    * Parachute - this pops out the back of your kart and slows you down
      a little for a few seconds only. Enough to drop you back one place
      if it's a close race though.
    * Anvil - gets dragged behind your kart on a rope for an even shorter
      amount of time than the parachute...but the drag effect is much
      stronger - your kart hardly moves at all. 

KNOWN BUGS:

    * No drive-with-the-mouse support.
    * Slow performance on CPU's less than ~450MHz.
    * Sometimes you can be pushed through a solid object if you are hit by
      another player when in contact with the surface. 

There might of course be more.
