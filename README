SuperTuxKart
==============
SuperTuxKart is a fun kart racing game. It was originally based on 
TuxKart (http://tuxkart.sourceforge.net) by Steve Baker, but by now
has developed a life on its own. The SuperTuxKart homepage can be found at:

The official SuperTuxKart forum is at:

A big "thank you" to Steve Baker for designing and implementing the
original TuxKart, and to the GotM team for their invaluable work.
See the data/CREDITS file for individual credits.

Hope you enjoy the game.

* You need a 3D graphics card that supports OpenGL or Mesa.
* You should have a CPU that's running at 450MHz or better.
* You'll need at least 128Mb RAM. 
* A sound card would be nice - but it's not essential.
* Ideally, you want a joystick with at least 6 buttons.

PLAYING THE GAME
================
SuperTuxKart is a kart racing game. Basically you run around the track,
and give your best shot at reaching the goal before your opponents. The ?
boxes can help you, and collection coins can build up your power, so you can
grab more than one collectable! But avoid the bananas, since they might
give you a nasty surprise.
