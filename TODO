Known bugs
==========
This contains either hard, or not reproducible errors. 

- Fix keyboard bug: the first time turning left/right while
  pressing the up key is ignored. See bug 6168
  Might be difficult to fix, since it occurs (it appears) in the interface
  between X and plib.
- Fix 'fall through track' bug #8384
  This appears to be a very special bug, which only happens on a certain
  configuration (Suse 10.1, dual core 32-bit Intel, ATI graphics card),
  and the error does NOT happen when using the same source code with
  wine under windows, or on a AMD 64 bit machine. 
  It might  be a compiler bug! [hiker]

Things that would be nice to fix, but are not urgent
=====================================================
- Write some documentation (a scrolling widget will help 
  displaying the additional information). Things to include:
  - taking shortcuts might result in not finishing a lap
  - lap display for other karts is red if kart is on last 
    track, green if finished.
- Add screenshot and 'topview' picture for each track, which can
  be displayed during track selection.
- Display skid marks again (currently disabled due to problems of 
  skid marks being 'in the air').
- Added settings menu (e.g. for MPH vs KPH (vs. KM/H), ...)
- Enable real fullscreen support
- Performance tuning
   - It's not too bad at the moment, but might be worth
     having a look again. [hiker]
- Re-activate wiki or create new one
   - Esp. include information on how to create/edit
     tracks.
- Top 10 lists for time trial, and grand prix.
- Support more colours to indicate which lap a kart
  is on. Display the time difference to either the
  kart in front of the kart, or to the first kart.
- Add track sections which must be passed in order to finish
  a lap. This would avoid karts taking shortcuts.
  That's already in the code, but currently the user does 
  not get any feedback if a driveline is skipped --> after 
  crossing the finishing line, the race might not end for a
  kart. Well, there is the 'wrong direction' message (?)
- Valgrind for memory bugs.
- Update the web page, make more screen shots, ...
- Tight/wide corner steering for AI. The AI is hitting the wall
  in very tight corners (e.g. subseatrack) [coz]


long term
=========
- OpenAL support (optional)  [patrick]
- Improved physics to support skidding
- Improved collision handling
- Add network multiplayer
- Make full use of OpenAL
- Performance tuning
  - Support for multi-core CPUs
    (while this is not strictly necessary, it might be a nice headline
    for news entries. The physics/collision detection would be
    easy to parallelise)
- More gadgets
  - Positive: - squirt oil on track to make karts slip, ...
  - Negative: - 'dirt on windscreen' - partial blackout of screen
- More flexibility for items. E.g. 
  - Tracks might hard code some items, change the distribution of some
    others (e.g. only a rocket at a certain location, but random choice
    which one the kart gets. Instead of jsut specifying 
    GREENHERRING, one could write: ZIPPER:ANVIL and one of the listed
    things would be picked randomly)
  - Grand prixs might want to overwrite this, e.g.:
    "war" grand prix: only rockets for all gadgets
  - Perhaps make good and bad things indistinguishable?
- sound/music manager needed
  Make it easy to replace sounds (which are currently hardcoded), e.g
  via a config file. Sound/music should be selectable for a track,
  but a grand prix should be able to overwrite this to create a consistent
  ambience, ...
- More tracks
- More grand prixs
- Support for translations(?)
- Support for easy-to-plugin different AIs, and allow different karts
  to have different AIs
- Code cleanup
  - Consistent style (which needs to be defined)
  - replace (as far as possible) all char* with std::string
  - ...
