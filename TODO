one of the best free linux games out there :) We need (in 
no particular order):

1) Musicians/sound engineers
   - Create additional background soundtrack
   - Create sound effects

2) Artists and track designer
   - Create additional tracks
   - Create additional art work for tracks,
     background images

3) Developers
   - See todo list below - it's rather long at the moment :)

4) Web master
   - Add wiki
   - Keep web page up to date

5) Tester
   - For just about everything
   - Esp. different platforms

6) Package creators
   - Create packages For 
     - most common linux Distributors
     - Windows
     - MaxOS (?? currently not sure if STK works on Macs)

7) Writers
   - Write documentation, ranging from man page, to
     a description for the web, to a design document, ...

If you want to help the SuperTuxKart - Project, please
contact us on the email list:

  supertuxkart-devel@list.berlios.de

Thanks in advance!

Urgent for release
===================
- Find acceptable physics parameters (e.g. kart engine and
  air resistance will determine highest speed).
  Perhaps make the maximum speed dependent on the skill level:
  higher skill levels --> faster karts [partly hiker, but feedback
  from all needed]
- Fix wheelies (make all wheelie parameters easily changeable without
  recompile, and if possible dependent on physic parameters.
  [hiker, in progress]
- Disable fullscreen (it doesn't work currently, and I expect it's
  too much work to fix this on all platforms before the release).
  [hiker, in progress]
- Restart race does not work (when in a (quick) race, press esc,
  select Restart --> nothing happens).
- Improve AI
  - tight/wide corner steering. [coz, in progress]
  - I've seen it once or twice that the AI would drive into a
    wall (towards the right of the track), and it would then
    just keep on driving into the same wall.  [coz, in progress]
  - Generally, the AI should be able to finish all tracks.  [coz, in progress]
- Fix gui bug: run grand prix, back to menu -> textures are wrong
  in character selection menu
  It is known that this can be fixed by removing
  loader->shared_textures.removeAll
  in gui/char_sel.cpp, but then the same problem happens when going
  from the next menu back to the char-sel menu.
- Decide which tracks should be included - some tracks appear to be
  somewhat unfinished.
- Give credit to the track designer (perhaps add a one line comment
  to each track, which is displayed when selecting a track?? Or just
  add then to the credits list?)
- Collect a list of 'new' items, which can be used for advertising
  the new release. [hiker, in progress]
- Update the web page, make more screen shots, ...
- Valgrind for memory bugs.
- Create a native windows executable.

Most likely too difficult/time consuming to be fixed before the release
=======================================================================
This contains either hard, or not reproducible errors. They are most 
likely to be ignored for now. The first problem appears to be very
difficult (and most likely related to the X driver and plib interaction),
while the second and third appear to be too unimportant to fix for now

- Fix keyboard bug: see bug 6168
  Might be difficult to fix! Worst case, document this, blame X/plib
  :)) and leave it.
- Fix 'fall through track' bug #8384
  This appears to be a very special bug, which only happens on a certain
  configuration (Suse 10.1, dual core 32-bit Intel, ATI graphics card),
  and the error does NOT happen when using the same source code with
  wine under windows, or on a AMD 64 bit machine. Therefore rather low 
  priority for now, unless we know that this happens more often. It might 
  be a compiler bug! [hiker]
- Fix not-reproducible ref-count error (I haven't seen this bug for
  a while, perhaps it was fixed when fixing something else?? Any
  reports on this would be helpful, otherwise we assume that this
  is fixed).

Things that would be nice to fix, but are not urgent
=====================================================
- Improved sound
   - More sounds, music, ...
- Performance tuning
   - It's not too bad at the moment, but might be worth
     having a look again. [hiker]
- Re-activate wiki or create new one
   - Esp. include information on how to create/edit
     tracks.
- Top 10 lists for time trial, and grand prix.
- Scale fonts dependent on resolution.
- Add a screen dump of each track to be displayed, instead
  of the outline.
- Add a 3rd dimension to herring data, so that the subsea
  and gownsbow can have herrings as well (currently, herring
  data is 2d only, the height is taken from computing the height
  of the track - which doesn't work correctly in case of lanes
  running on top of each other (gown), or a track running inside
  a tube (subsea).

long term
=========
- OpenAL support (optional)  [patrick]
- Improved physics to support skidding
- Improved collision handling
- Add network multiplayer
- Make full use of OpenAL
- Performance tuning
  - Support for multi-core CPUs
    (while this is not strictly necessary, it might be a nice headline
    for news entries. The physics/collision detection would be
    easy to parallelise)
- More gadgets
  - Positive: - squirt oil on track to make karts slip, ...
  - Negative: - 'dirt on windscreen' - partial blackout of screen
- More flexibility for items. E.g. 
  - Tracks might hard code some items, change the distribution of some
    others (e.g. only a rocket at a certain location, but random choice
    which one the kart gets. Instead of jsut specifying 
    GREENHERRING, one could write: ZIPPER:ANVIL and one of the listed
    things would be picked randomly)
  - Grand prixs might want to overwrite this, e.g.:
    "war" grand prix: only rockets for all gadgets
  - Perhaps make good and bad things indistinguishable?
- More tracks
- More grand prixs
- Support for translations(?)
- Support for easy-to-plugin different AIs, and allow different karts
  to have different AIs


DONE
====
- Fix 'not on triangle' bug
    A crash happens if a kart should leave the track completely
- Rename configuration directory/file from .tuxkart to .supertuxkart
- Make steering wheel speed adjustable
- Make game installable in a configurable directory
- Add short 'help' screen
- Add 'about' screen
- Update readme
- Update (c) information in sources
- Update/add todo/known bugs list
- Adding item boxes to levels which don't have them.
- Remove obstacle/road-work on tuxtrack, since the AI doesn't
  know about it and might very likely just drive into it ...
  over and over again (work around, till the AI becomes better)
- Giving material in tracks, from which the kart can't go back
  to the race, a 'reset' property (e.g. hole in volcano, or under
  bridge of sand track, where the karts can fall it but can't come
  back from), so that karts falling into these paces will be rescued
  automatically
- Update doc directory: most of the information is tuxkart only,
  and still the useful documentation should be merged into the
  Implementation.txt file for now.
- Work-around rescue problems 
- Physics
   - slow down when driving upwards, accelerate when driving
     down
