    <!-- gravity-center-shift is the shift of the chassis with regards to the center of
                              mass. E.g. with the the value commented out below the 
                              chassis will be 30 cm higher than the  center of mass - 
                              or the center of mass will be 30 cm lower than the  
                              middle of the chassis. So this effectively lowers the 
                              center of mass, making the kart more stable and less 
                              likely to topple over. Default (if nothing is defined 
                              here) is that the center of the mass is at the very bottom

                         too often. It also helps with making it easier to push the

                         impossible). A value of 1/maxFPS / 2 will guarantee that

<!-- GENERAL KART DEFAULTS


engine-power and max-speed have 3 values, one for hard, medium and low
difficulties; Max speed right now would be 116 101 90 km/h.

mass: kart's mass
suspension-stiffness: kart's suspension stiffness

max-speed-reverse-ratio is the percentage of max speed for reverse gear

jump-velocity is the z-axis velocity set when a jump is initiated. This
will cause the kart to start rising, till it is pulled back by gravity.
A higher value means higher Z velocity, meaning the kart will rise faster
and higher, and will be in the air longer

collision-side-impulse is an additional (artificial) impulse that pushes
the slower kart out of the way of the faster karts (i.e. sideways to the
faster kart) when a collision happens. This is for now disables, since
it needs tuning and additionally has the problem that the amount of push
a hit kart receives depends on the orientation - if a kart is pushed
in the direction it is driving, it will be more (no friction from tires),
while when pushed to the side, hardly anything happens.
 
vert-rescue-offset is the z-axis offset when kart is being put back on track
after being rescued, it's a fraction of kart height

gear-switch-ratio defines at what ratio of the maximum speed what gear is
selected, e.g. 0.25 means that if the speed is bigger or equal to 0.25 x
maxSpeed then use gear 1, 0.5 means if the speed is bigger or equal to 0.5 x
maxSpeed then gear 2.

gear-power-increase contains the increase in max power (to simulate
different gears), e.g. 2.5 as first entry means: 2.5*maxPower in gear 1
| first  | second |  third | .

wheel-front-right, wheel-front-left, wheel-rear-right and wheel-rear-left
give the position of the physics raycast wheels relative to the center of
gravity. Default is to use the corners of the chassis to attach the wheels
to.

rubber-band-max-length is the maximum length of rubber band

rubber-band-force is the force a plunger/rubber band applies to the kart(s).

rubber-band-duration is the duration a rubber band acts.
