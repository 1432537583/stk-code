<!-- GENERAL KART DEFAULTS

time-full-steer = is the time when a player's input goes from neutral
steering to extreme left or right.

time-full-steer-ai is the time for the AI to go from neutral steering to
extreme left (or right). This can be used to reduce 'shaking' of AI karts
caused by changing steering direction too often. It also helps with making it
easier to push the AI karts (otherwise micro-corrections make this nearly
impossible). A value of 1/maxFPS / 2 will guarantee that the wheel can go from
-1 to +1 steering in one frame, basically  disabling this mechanism.

gravity-center-shift is the shift of the chassis with regards to the center of
mass. E.g. with the the value commented out below the chassis will be 30 cm
higher than the  center of mass - or the center of mass will be 30 cm lower
than the  middle of the chassis. So this effectively lowers the center of
mass, making the kart more stable and less likely to topple over. Default (if
nothing is defined here) is that the center of the mass is at the very bottom
of the chassis!

nitro-power-boost is the increase in engine power, i.e. 1=plus 100%

skid-increase: multiplicative increase of skidding factor in each frame.
skid-decrease: multiplicative decrease of skidding factor in each frame.
skid-max: maximum skidding factor = maximum increase of steering angle.
time-till-max-skid: Time till maximum skidding is reached.
skid-visual: Additional graphical rotation of kart.
slipstream slipstream-length: How far behind a kart slipstream works
slipstream-collect-time: How many seconds of sstream give  maximum benefit
slipstream-use-time: How long the benefit will last.
slipstream-add-power: Additional power due to sstreaming. 1 = +100%
slipstream-min-speed: Minimum speed necessary for slipstream to take effect.

min-speed-radius and max-speed-radius define the smallest turn radius at
lowest speed (4.64 m at speed 0) and at high speed (13.5 m at speed 12 m/s).
Maximum steering angles for speeds in between will be interpolated. This
allows for tighter turns at lower speeds. The actual steering  angle is
dependent on the wheel base of the kart:
radius = wheel_base/sin(steering_angle)
By specifying the radius the steering behaviour can be defined independent
of the kart size.


engine-power and max-speed have 3 values, one for hard, medium and low
difficulties; Max speed right now would be 116 101 90 km/h.

mass: kart's mass
suspension-stiffness: kart's suspension stiffness

max-speed-reverse-ratio is the percentage of max speed for reverse gear

jump-velocity is the z-axis velocity set when a jump is initiated. This
will cause the kart to start rising, till it is pulled back by gravity.
A higher value means higher Z velocity, meaning the kart will rise faster
and higher, and will be in the air longer

collision-side-impulse is an additional (artificial) impulse that pushes
the slower kart out of the way of the faster karts (i.e. sideways to the
faster kart) when a collision happens. This is for now disables, since
it needs tuning and additionally has the problem that the amount of push
a hit kart receives depends on the orientation - if a kart is pushed
in the direction it is driving, it will be more (no friction from tires),
while when pushed to the side, hardly anything happens.
 
z-rescue-offset is the z-axis offset when kart is being put back on track
after being rescued, it's a fraction of kart height

gear-switch-ratio defines at what ratio of the maximum speed what gear is
selected, e.g. 0.25 means that if the speed is bigger or equal to 0.25 x
maxSpeed then use gear 1, 0.5 means if the speed is bigger or equal to 0.5 x
maxSpeed then gear 2.

gear-power-increase contains the increase in max power (to simulate
different gears), e.g. 2.5 as first entry means: 2.5*maxPower in gear 1
| first  | second |  third | .

wheel-front-right, wheel-front-left, wheel-rear-right and wheel-rear-left
give the position of the physics raycast wheels relative to the center of
gravity. Default is to use the corners of the chassis to attach the wheels
to.

rubber-band-max-length is the maximum length of rubber band

rubber-band-force is the force a plunger/rubber band applies to the kart(s).

rubber-band-duration is the duration a rubber band acts.
