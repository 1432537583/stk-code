Some more or less unsorted implementation details. Some comments
are included in [].


1) Collectables
===============
A collectable is an object used once in each kart. It stores:
- a type (e.g. zipper)
- an icon (displayed in the gui)
- a number (how many of this items have been collected)
- can have a model (for missiles etc). 
The information about collectables is stored in several data files
(data/*.collectables, and data/*.projectiles). The mapping from
collectableType to data file is currently hard-coded in 
CollectableManager (look for initCollectableType and ict).

When a red herring is hit, Collectable::hitRedHerring for
the collectable being used in the current kart is called. When a
collectable is used, Collectable::use is called from PlayerKart::update
or AutoKart::update. 

2) Projectiles
==============
Projectiles inherit from Moveables. The projectile_manager
maintains a dynamical list of unused projectils (deletedProjectils). 
If a new projectile is needed (because of the use of a collectable):
- one projectile from this list will be used (and removed from
  this list) if one is available,
- otherwise a new one will created.
The new projectile is added to the list activeProjectiles, see 
ProjectileManager::newProjectile. When the projectile hits
something, the 'somethingWasHit' flag gets set. This flag
get tested after updating (i.e. moving) all projectiles from
ProjectileManager::update. In case of a hit, a new explosion
object is used (similarly from either a list of unused explosions
or created newly, see ProjectileManager::newExplosion), the
projectile is removed from the scene, and put in the dynamical
list of available projectils for later reuse (deletedProjectiles).
The speed and model of the projectile are taken from the
collectable_manager (who takes this information from the files
data/*.projectile).
[Note: this design is a little bit awkward, since not all 
collectables have/need speed. A more complicated implementation 
might make the ProjectileManager inherit from the CollectableManager,
... - but on the other hands, that makes (imho) all further handling
more complicated: e.g. depending on whether the collectable is
a missile or not, different managers have to be called ...]
