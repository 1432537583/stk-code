INTRODUCTION
------------

SuperTuxKart (abbreviated STK) is a kart racing game, based on
TuxKart (http://tuxkart.sourceforge.net) by Steve Baker. It was
picked up by the Linux Game of the Month project and got a big
overhaul during this time, but was left in an unfinished state.

A new set of maintainers, namely hiker & coz, took over in 2006.
You can find more details on:

REQUIREMENTS
------------

Hardware:
* You need a 3D graphics card that can support OpenGL or Mesa.
* You should have a CPU that's running at 266MHz or better.
* You'll need at least 32Mb RAM.
* A sound card would be nice - but it's not essential.
* Ideally, you want a joystick - preferably one with at least 6
  buttons - you can also drive from the keyboard or the mouse,
  thought currently it is hard to drive with the mouse.

Software:
Right now, SuperTuxKart runs under Linux and under Windoze using
the CygWin package. We hope MSVC/Windoze, MacOS, BSD, BeOS, etc.
ports to follow.

You need the following programs installed:

OpenGL (or Mesa 3.0 or later)
    http://www.opengl.org ,  http://www.mesa3d.org

PLIB 1.8.4 
    http://plib.sourceforge.net

SDL 1.2
    http://www.libsdl.org

OpenAL (optional, requires ALUT,   MikMod)
    http://www.openal.org

ALUT   (optional, requires OpenAL, MikMod)
    http://www.openal.org

MikMod (optional, requires OpenAL, ALUT)
    http://mikmod.raphnet.net

Bullet (optional)

If you wish to use bullet, you should see the README.bullet file
that should be in the main SuperTuxKart directory.


CONTROLLING YOUR KART
---------------------

To win your races you will need to master your controls. The
first and second player have predefined controls:

Player 1:
  Steer      : Left / Right arrow
  Accelerate : Up arrow
  Brake      : Down arrow
  Use item   : Right control
  Wheelie    : Right shift
  Rescue     : Backspace

Player 2:
  Steer      : J / L key
  Accelerate : I key
  Brake      : K key
  Use item   : M key
  Wheelie    : . key
  Rescue     : / key

Player 3 and 4 do not have default control configurations.

The rescue button is meant to be used if your kart is stuck; it
will send you to the track with your approximate progress, but
it will take a few seconds.

The Escape key pauses the game and shows the race menu. Also,
pressing Escape in a menu will exit from it, and in the main
menu it closes the game.

There are also some special functions:

  F9 key  - Toggle fullscreen during the race. Doesn't works on
            Windows.

  F10 key - Save the last 1000 frames into a file ./history.dat
            This can be used to reproduce problems occurring
            during a race. This is mainly useful for developers.

  F11 key - Toggle wire-frame view.

  F12 key - Toggle frame-per-second display.


THE RACE SCREEN
---------------

This screen has several components:

  Position display (left) : here you will see the places of
  everyone participating in the race; after the leader goes
  though the goal, a counter will appear next to their images
  showing how much time behind they are. The places are
  initially colored in white, which will become a bit more red
  with every lap finished; after the race is finished the
  place appear in green.

  Track map (bottom left corner) : this will show the position
  of everyone, in relation to the track; humans are drawn with
  bigger dots.

  Lap (right of the track map) : the left number shows how many
  laps you have completed, the right number shows how many laps
  you have to complete to finish the race.

  Item (top) : the number of items and what is that you are
  holding is displayed here.

  Power bar (right) : it displays how much power you have by
  grabbing energizers.

  Speed bar (bottom right) : shows how fast you are moving.

  Steering wheel: when you steer, the front wheels do not rotate
  to their limit instantly; instead, they take less than a
  second to achieve full rotation. The current rotation is
  displayed here.
  
  Current place: here it is shown how much you have advanced in
  comparation with your competitors.

  Time: how much time it takes for you to reach the goal.


GAME MODES
----------

Three different game modes are available:
1) Grand Prix
   A set of several races, each with several laps

2) Quick Race
   A single race (with between 1 and 5 laps)

3) Time Trial
   A single race with a single lap only


MULTIPLAYER
-----------

Split screen multi-player is supported, though you need a
somewhat powerful computer and graphics card to get a high frame
rate in this case. Network multi-player is not yet supported.

When playing with your friends, the screen will be divided in
cuadrants. You *need* to set up the 3rd and 4th player controls,
but you probably will want to set different controls for the 1st
and 2nd player too.

Also, after you finish the race, you might want to go back to
give your friends some trouble!


COLLECTABLES
------------

There are currently many 'good things' you can get (triggered by
touching an item box) and a few 'bad things'.

When you pick up one of the good things, you will see it on your
item box, and activate it by using an item (see above for
default key bindings)

Bad things happen immediately - and last for a few seconds
before 'going away' by themselves.

Notice that (unlike some kart games), the computer controlled
players also collect and use power-ups in the same way you do.

Energizers gradually fill up the energy level - as you collect
more, you'll find that an item cube will subsequently give you
two, three, four or five power-ups at one time!

Good Things:

 Missiles: unguided but fast. If they hit anything (including
 the track), they explode impressively. The effect on a Kart is
 to stop it dead - so you have to accelerate again from zero.

 Homing missiles: slower than the regular kind - but they track
 the nearest kart and are quite hard to shake off.

 Fuzzy blobs/Spark: even slower still, a kart can outrun them quite
 easily. They ricochet off the sides of the track and only
 explode when they hit a Kart. Since they are not moving fast,
 they'll tend to stay close to where you dropped them, thought
 you won't know exactly where.

 Portable Zippers: these are just like the zippers on the track
 itself - they give you a sudden acceleration and temporarily
 increase the top speed of your kart.

 Portable parachutes: this pops out the back of all the karts
 in a better position than you and slows them down a for some
 seconds. The worse your position is, the higher the
 probabilities of getting this you have (but they are still
 small). You can only have one at a time.

 Portable anvil: the driver in the first position gets dragged
 by a heavy anvil, allowing other drivers to catch up with
 him... like the portable parachutes, the worse your position
 is, the higher probabilities of getting this you have. However,
 you can't get this if the driver in the first position already
 finished the race.

Bad Things:

 Parachute: this pops out the back of your kart and slows you down
 a little for a few seconds only. Enough to drop you back one place
 if it's a close race though.
 
 Anvil: gets dragged behind your kart on a rope for an even shorter
 amount of time than the parachute... but the drag effect is much
 stronger; your kart hardly moves at all. 


GAME MECHANICS AND TIPS
-----------------------

You are a racer in SuperTuxKart, and your goal is to reach the
finish line before your opponents, but as a bonus you might want
to show your awesome driving skills.

The item cubes contain helpful objects; which item you get is
matter of luck. If you have an item already, you will only get
another item the random selection chooses the same item type as
the one you already have.

The energizers will increase the number of items you grab from a
single item cube. You may only have up to 5 items, except the
anvil and the parachute, since anvils are so heavy and you have
so many parachutes, there is not much room and you can only
carry one!

On the track there could be zippers, which will give you a boost
when you go over them. Avoid water and lava, since you can't
drive inside them and you will have to be rescued just before
you touch them!

There are also nasty things left on the track which will put an
anvil or a parachute on your kart.

It is best to drive in straight lines as much as posible without
going out of the track.

If you don't have items that you wish to use, try not to be in
a collision course towards other karts, since they might have
items of their own to throw at you! also, if they crash you
could go down with them.

If you are running rather fast, you can pop a wheelie, which gives
you an additional speed boost, but you can't steer your kart 
while doing a wheelie (since your front wheels are not touching
the track), so be careful.

Hitting another kart does not do any damage to your kart or the
other kart, one of the karts will just be forced to a stand still,
loosing precious seconds.

When all human controlled karts finish the race, the game will wait
some seconds for the AI to finish the race. If the AI doesn't, it
will use the AI's current position as their final position.


BUGS IN THIS VERSION
--------------------

* Slow performance on CPU's less than ~450MHz.

* Sometimes you can be pushed through a solid object if you are
hit by another player when in contact with the surface. 

There might of course be more.
