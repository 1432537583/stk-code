The files in this directory should replace the corresponding
files in an irrlicht-1.5 distribution. They add a new function
draw2DPolygon (with different parameters than the existing 
function with the same name). The new function is used to
draw the speedometer, and the track display with the kart
symbols on it.

If an unpatched version of irrlicht is used, STK will still
compile, but the above mentioned elements will be missing.

We hope that this function (or a similar one) will be 
included in the next irrlicht release, making the use of
a patched version unnecessary.
