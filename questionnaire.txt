Dear SuperTuxKart tester,

while we are always interested in feedback, we have a few questions we
would like to focus on, and appreciate if you could give us your
opinion. You can either email this to the STK development list
(supertuxkart-devel@lists.sourceforge.net), or post on the
corresponding thread on our forum at 
http://supertuxkart.sourceforge.net/forum

Look for the thread "Feedback for 0.5rc1".


1) Faster music at the last 30 seconds
   Is this a good idea, or too annoying?

2) General impression of music (esp. non-looping songs)
   Should we only have loop-able music (and therefore less variety), or
   more songs, even if they are not loop-able?

3) Locked items
   Is this generally frustrating that not everything is accessible from 
   the beginning? Or is it motivating to play more?

4) Challenges
   Are they too difficult/too easy?
   Should we support different levels of challenges - e.g. you could
   use STK on 'easy' or 'hard'. Easy would have less difficult 
   challenges, so if you are stuck with one challenge you can
   solve this challenge on easy.

5) Wheelies
   Are wheelies fun, or are they too boring since you can't steer?

6) Any general comments, suggestions?


Thanks a lot for your time and effort!

  The STK Development Team
