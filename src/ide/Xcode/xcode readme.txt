Xcode project file readme

* This project file will enable you to build STK using Xcode on mac OS X.
* It assumes you have all dependencies installed like if you were building from terminal however.
* For STK to run, you will need to rightclick on the executable in the project tree, select get info, and set the execution working directory to the STK root (select "custom" then enter the paths) so it can find its data files
