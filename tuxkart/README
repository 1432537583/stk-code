INSTALLATION:

Installation instructions are pretty basic,
and are covered in the documentation directory 'doc'.

First make sure that you have the following packages
installed:

   GLIDE (if you have a 3Dfx card)
   OpenGL (or Mesa)
   GLUT (the GL Utility Toolkit)
   PLIB version 1.2.0 or later - which can be obtained from:
     http://plib.sourceforge.net

Once that is done, it should be a simple matter of changing
to the directory where all this stuff is unpacked and type:

 ./configure
 make

You can run the game from the directoryyou downloaded it
into - or (as 'root') you can install it into
/usr/local/share/games/tuxkart by typing;

 make install

However, you might want to check the full documentation -
especially if you need to install Mesa/GLIDE/GLUT before
you can start.

All documents are in HTML - so view them with your web browser.

STARTING THE GAME:

Just 'cd' into the download directory and run 'src/tuxkart',
or run '/usr/local/games/tuxkart' if you did a 'make install'.

If you have a Voodoo graphics card, don't forget the usual:

  csh/tcsh:

    setenv MESA_GLX_FX fullscreen

  or for sh/bash:

    MESA_GLX_FX=fullscreen
    export MESA_GLX_FX

Select the number of laps and which course you'd like to race
on then click 'start game' to get going.

PLAYING THE GAME:

Ideally, you should get a joystick with at least six buttons
(I use a 'MakoPad-PC' gamepad).

Joystick Left/Right:  Steer.

A button - Accellerate.
B button - Brake.
C button - Use an item (see below).
D button - unused.
L button - Pop a wheelie (if you are going fast enough).
R button - Jump.

In addition, from the keyboard:

R key - Restart the race.
X key - Exit the game.
P key - Pause.
SPACE - Pop up or Hide the menu bar.

From the Menu bar, you can turn sound effects and music
on and off, enable or disable the 'mousetrap' (which keeps
the mouse in the window to stop you accidentally losing
the mouse pointer on Voodoo-1/2 hardware)
